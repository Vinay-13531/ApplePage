2020 is certainly shaping up to be a year like no other (well, it bears some resemblance to 1918 if you are comparing pandemics) but Apple's new product cycle doesn't seem to be slowing down. Already this year we've seen Apple launch a new iPad Pro, the iPhone SE (2020), a MacBook Air with improved keyboard, a new 13in MacBook Pro (also with the improved keyboard). Apple's also doubled the storage in the Mac mini and boosted the build-to-order graphics card option for the 16in MacBook Pro.
<br>
<br>
In June the company held its Worldwide Developer Conference at which it announced its plans for the next set of operating systems: iOS 14, iPadOS 14, macOS 11 Big Sur and so on.
<br>
<br>
It also made the shocking, but expected, announcement that it will be transitioning away from Intel processors to its own Apple Silicon over the next couple of years.
<br>
<br>
Apple says that the first Macs powered by Apple Silicon will be available to buy by the end of 2020. But that doesn't mean all Mac updates are on hold. On the contrary, Apple CEO Tim Cook said there will be "exciting" Intel-powered Mac updates still to come. We're anticipating a update to the 27in iMac, for example. But the advent of the Silicon Mac does make us wonder if now is really a good time to buy an Intel Mac.
<br>
<br>
There's plenty of non-Mac products in the pipeline though. We should also see an iPhone with 5G capabilities, a sleep tracking feature for the next generation Apple Watch, a new HomePod, Apple TV, and an iPad Air with a Home button embedded below the glass.
<br>
<br>
Plus, you can expect the surprise return of AirPower - the wireless-charging device that was missing presumed dead - and the arrival of the mysterious AirTags that have been popping up in software for a while now. 
<br>
<br>
If that's enough to whet your appetite read on for all the details including when you can expect to see them.
<br>
<br>
In this article we take a look at what we can expect from Apple in 2020. We've investigated every rumour and trend we could find to bring you our predictions. Read on to find out what could be in store. You can expect Apple to hold online events to launch some of these new products - we don't anticipate the company inviting anyone to attend keynotes in person for the foreseeable future.
<br>
<br>
<h3>iMac</h3>
<br>
<br>
We've already mentioned the iMac - we are that sure that it will be updated soon. The biggest indicator is that Apple isn't selling the 27in model right now - it's saying shipping isn't until mid July. But while that suggests that the 27in iMac might get a much needed update soon, what of the 21.5in iMac?
<br>
<br>
There are reports suggesting that Apple could make some changes to the design of the iMac that could result in a 23in model (to replace the 21.5in iMac). This would be achieved by reducing the bezels.
<br>
<br>
Hopefully we'll see a similar change for the 27in iMac - we'd love to see a 30in model.
<br>
<br>
We also hope to see some other cosmetic changes to the design - including better ergonomics. 
<br>
<br>
It's what's inside that counts though, and we also hope that Apple addresses the ageing processors and the embarrassment of the hard drive models.
<br>
<br>
We're not sure about the future of the iMac Pro - Apple could discontinue it now that the Mac Pro is here, or it may update it alongside the 27in iMac.
<br>
<br>
When? June/July 2020
<br>
<br>
<h3>AirPods headphones</h3>
Apple is said to be working on various headphones including the AirPods X (said to be for sport), AirPods Pro Lite (cheaper version of the AirPods Pro), and some over-the-ear headphones
<br>
<br>
When? Summer 2020
<br>
<br>
<h3>Apple TV</h3>
On 1 November 2019 Apple launched its new TV+ service via which it is now delivering a collection of exclusive TV shows - and some free shows - with more to come. With this focus on television, it seems likely that the Apple TV set-top-box will see a revamp in 2020. We may even see a cheaper Apple TV launch, which could help Apple get its content out to the masses. We could also see an 8K version - although that may not arrive in 2020.
<br>
<br>
Although as more and more TV manufacturers add support for AirPlay 2 to their sets, maybe there will be no need for the Apple TV set-top box in the future.
<br>
<br>
When? Summer 2020
<br>
<br>
<h3>HomePod 2</h3>
There's one more *Pod hopefully coming our way. We expect Apple to update the HomePod - although it's not really clear what the company could do to improve the speaker, other than make it cheaper.
<br>
<br>
There are rumours that Apple could launch a smaller, cheaper HomePod in a bid to better compete with Amazon and Google. A cheaper device would certainly help it sell a few more of the Siri-powered speakers.
<br>
<br>
Alternatively, a Siri-powered Beats speaker could make an appearance.
<br>
<br>
Or Apple could give up on the HomePod and push Apple Music on to competitor smart speakers - Apple Music is already compatible with the Amazon Echo, for example. Read: How to get Apple Music on Amazon Echo. However, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple has a dedicated team working to save the HomePod from its poor sales, so hopefully there will be good news soon.
<br>
<br>
When? Summer 2020
<br>
<br>
<h3>iOS, iPadOS, macOS and the rest of the OSs</h3>
Apple has let us know about the changes coming in iOS 14, iPadOS 14, macOS Big Sur and the other OSs - tvOS & watchOS 6. The developer beta is available now and the pubic beta will be available soon. But what everyone will want to know is when are the new features coming to their iPhones, iPads and Macs.
<br>
<br>
When? September 2020
<br>
<br>
<h3>5G iPhone</h3>
As for the new phones, Apple is said to be set to introduce 5G-capable iPhones.
<br>
<br>
We have lots of information about Apple's plans for an 5G iPhone, and a roundup of all the iPhone 12 rumours.
<br>
<br>
When? September 2020
<br>
<br>
<h3>Apple Watch</h3>
Among other new features the 2020 Apple Watch is said to be getting Sleep Tracking, which is something people have been requesting for a long time.
<br>
<br>

When? September 2020
<br>
<br>
<h3>AirTag</h3>
A bit of a wildcard this one but there is plenty of evidence suggesting it's true: Apple is gearing up to launch a Tag object tracker that will help you track of important items and show you where to find them via the Find My app.

<br>
<br>
When? September 2020
<br>
<br>
<h3>AirPower</h3>
If you thought that Apple had given up on its dream of making one device that could wirelessly charge an iPhone and AirPods at the same time we'll forgive you because Apple's said as much. But it turns out that the project may not have been completely abandoned. Apple is said to be gearing up to launch the AirPower after all.
<br>
<br>
When? September 2020
<br>
<br>
<h3>AR Glasses</h3>
Apple's made clear its interest in augmented reality, and we may hear more about Apple's plans to make Apple AR Glasses in 2020!
<br>
<br>
While the rumours suggest we won't see Apple's AR product until 2021 or 2022, it's possible that Apple may share its plans with developers at some point in 2020 in an attempt to get them to design apps for the new device.
<br>
<br>
When? September 2020
<br>
<br>
<h3>iPad Air</h3>
Apparently a new iPad Air will arrive later this year that will feature a full screen, but rather than sporting a notch and Face ID, it will have a Home button and Touch ID integrated under the screen.
<br>
<br>
When? October 2020
<br>
<br>
<h3>Mac with Apple-made processor</h3>
It's long been rumoured that Apple wants to stop relying on Intel's processors, bringing processor development in house and now we know it to be the case.
<br>
<br>
Apple's said that the first of these new Silicon Macs will launch in 2020.
<br>
<br>
When? October 2020
<br>
<br>
<h3>MacBook Pro</h3>
Apple's already updated the 13in MacBook Pro this year - or that's what you might think. Actually, Apple updated the mid-range 13in model, giving it a new 10th generation processor. But the entry-level model didn't get a new processor, all it got was double the storage and a new keyboard.
<br>
<br>
So, we still expect Apple to update the 13in MacBook Pro in 2020, and the update could be quite exciting: we might see a 14in MacBook Pro thanks to thinner bezels around the screen.
<br>
<br>
There is even a chance that the entry-level model could be one of those first few Macs to gain a Silicon chip...
<br>
<br>
As for the 16in MacBook Pro - an update to that model, which launched in November 2019 - is anticipated for later in the year.
<br>
<br>
When? October 2020
<br>
<br>
<h3>Apple Car</h3>
The Apple Car was the hot rumour of 2016, but it's since emerged that Apple has scaled back its ambitions on this front but something is definitely happening in the motoring field. The company is said to have had up to 1,000 developers working on the so-called Project Titan, and to have set up various different front companies, including Faraday Futures and Sixty Eight Research.
<br>
<br>
Industry chatter suggests 2020 is a possible date for a launch - which sounds crazy to us. But, if this is correct, it might be worth holding back on upgrading to your existing run-around until then.
